# Task List: Advanced Canvas Tools (Export, Copy/Paste, Lasso, Multi-Select Transform, Nudging)

Generated from: `prd-canvas-tools.md`

## Relevant Files

- `src/components/toolbar/Toolbar.tsx` - Main toolbar component, add export and lasso buttons
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Main canvas component, implement export, lasso drawing, transformer
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx` - Canvas state management, add clipboard state and copy/paste/duplicate logic
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions, add clipboard types and lasso mode
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Canvas hook, expose new functions
- `src/pages/CanvasEditorPage.tsx` - Main editor page, add keyboard event listeners
- `src/utils/canvasHelpers.ts` - Helper functions for point-in-polygon algorithm

### Notes

- Konva provides `toDataURL()` for export and `Transformer` component for multi-select transform
- Point-in-polygon algorithm uses ray casting method
- Clipboard state is internal (React state), not browser clipboard API
- Transform origin is handled automatically by Konva Transformer with opposite anchor behavior
