## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

**1. Connection State (Critical)**
- No indication when Firebase disconnects
- Users can attempt edits while offline, causing confusion
- No automatic reconnection handling
- Lost edits when connection drops

**2. Presence Issues (High Priority)**
- User colors may not persist correctly across sessions
- Users may appear offline when they're actually online
- No cleanup when users disconnect ungracefully
- Inconsistent user indicators across components

**3. Collaboration Awareness (Medium Priority)**
- Users don't know when others are editing
- No feedback on who created/modified what
- Silent updates can be disorienting

**4. Missing Core Features (Medium Priority)**
- No way to export/share work outside the app
- No standard copy/paste workflow (users expect Cmd+C/V)
- Only rectangular selection available

---

## Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: Connection State Management

**Goal:** Make the app resilient to network disconnections with clear user feedback

#### User Experience

**Connected State (Normal)**
- Green dot indicator in top-right corner
- All canvas operations enabled
- Real-time sync active

**Disconnected State (Read-Only)**
- Red dot indicator with "Disconnected" label
- Canvas becomes read-only (semi-transparent overlay)
- Toolbar buttons disabled
- Toast notification: "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
- Show countdown timer for reconnection attempts

**Reconnecting State**
- Orange/yellow dot indicator with "Reconnecting..." label
- Spinner animation
- Canvas remains read-only
- Show attempt number (e.g., "Reconnecting... (attempt 2 of 5)")

**Reconnected State**
- Green dot indicator returns
- Toast notification: "Reconnected! Your changes are syncing..."
- Canvas operations re-enabled
- Sync any pending changes (if queued locally)

#### Technical Approach

**Connection Monitoring**
- Use Firebase's `.info/connected` special location
- Listen for connection state changes
- Track connection/disconnection timestamps
- Count reconnection attempts (max 5 attempts, 30 seconds apart)

**Read-Only Mode**
- Add semi-transparent overlay to canvas when disconnected
- Prevent rectangle creation, movement, deletion
- Show tooltip: "Canvas is read-only while offline"
- Disable all toolbar buttons
- Prevent keyboard shortcuts

**Reconnection Strategy**
- Auto-retry connection every 30 seconds
- Max 5 attempts before showing "Manual reconnect required"
- Button to force reconnection
- On successful reconnect, sync any local pending changes

**State Preservation**
- Queue local changes during disconnect (optional enhancement)
- On reconnect, apply queued changes in order
- If conflicts occur, use last-write-wins
- Show toast for each synced change

---

### Feature 2: User Presence Polish

**Goal:** Fix inconsistencies in user presence tracking and make colors persistent

#### Issues to Fix

**1. Color Persistence**
- **Problem:** User colors may change between sessions
- **Solution:** Store user color in `/users/{userId}` on first login
- **Behavior:** Once assigned, color never changes (unless manually reset)

**2. Online Status Accuracy**
- **Problem:** Users may appear offline when online
- **Solution:** Proper Firebase presence setup with onDisconnect()
- **Behavior:** Status updates within 5 seconds of actual state change

**3. Disconnection Cleanup**
- **Problem:** Dead connections don't get cleaned up
- **Solution:** Firebase onDisconnect() to set isOnline: false
- **Behavior:** User removed from list within 30 seconds of disconnect

**4. Cursor Visibility**
- **Problem:** Cursors may linger after user disconnects
- **Solution:** Remove cursor when user goes offline
- **Behavior:** Cursor disappears immediately when status changes

#### Technical Approach

**Firebase Structure Updates:**
```
/users/{userId}
  id: string
  email: string
  color: string (assigned on first login, never changes)
  createdAt: timestamp
  lastSeenAt: timestamp

/presence/{canvasId}/{userId}
  userId: string
  email: string
  color: string (copied from /users/{userId})
  isOnline: boolean
  lastActive: timestamp
  cursor: { x, y }
```

**Color Assignment Strategy:**
- Check if user exists in `/users/{userId}`
- If new user, assign next available color from palette
- Store color permanently
- On subsequent logins, read existing color

**Presence Management:**
- Set online status when joining canvas
- Use onDisconnect() to automatically set offline on disconnect
- Filter offline users from cursor rendering
- Only show users where `isOnline: true` in online users list

---

### Feature 3: Activity Notifications

**Goal:** Show toast notifications when other users make changes

#### User Experience

**Notification Types:**

1. **User Joined**
   - Toast: "John joined the canvas"
   - Icon: User icon with color indicator
   - Duration: 3 seconds

2. **User Left**
   - Toast: "Sarah left the canvas"
   - Icon: User icon (grayed out)
   - Duration: 3 seconds

3. **Object Created**
   - Toast: "Mike created a rectangle"
   - Icon: Rectangle icon with user color
   - Duration: 2 seconds

4. **Object Deleted**
   - Toast: "Anna deleted an object"
   - Icon: Trash icon with user color
   - Duration: 2 seconds

5. **Canvas Cleared** (if multiple objects deleted at once)
   - Toast: "David cleared 5 objects"
   - Icon: Multiple trash icons
   - Duration: 3 seconds

**Behavior Rules:**
- **Only show for other users' actions** (not for current user)
- **Debounce rapid actions** (e.g., dragging doesn't spam notifications)
- **Group similar actions** (e.g., "John created 3 rectangles")
- **Position:** Top-right corner, below connection indicator
- **Max visible:** 3 notifications at once (oldest auto-dismiss)

#### Technical Approach

**Action Tracking:**
- Monitor object creation/deletion in CanvasContext
- Monitor user join/leave in PresenceContext
- Check if action was by current user (skip notification)
- Get user info from presence data

**Debouncing & Grouping:**
- Don't notify for cursor movements or drag updates
- Only notify when action is complete (object created/deleted)
- Group actions within 2-second window
- Flush grouped actions after timeout

**Optional Settings:**
- User preference to disable notifications
- Stored in localStorage: `notificationsEnabled: boolean`
- Toggle in settings menu (future enhancement)

---

### Feature 4: Export Canvas as PNG

**Goal:** Allow users to export the current canvas view as a PNG image

#### User Experience

**UI Location:**
- Add "Export PNG" button to toolbar (new section at bottom)
- Icon: Download icon
- Tooltip: "Export canvas as PNG (Cmd+E)"

**Export Flow:**
1. User clicks "Export PNG" button (or presses Cmd+E)
2. Canvas is rendered to PNG (entire 5000x5000px workspace)
3. Browser download dialog opens with filename: `CollabCanvas_[timestamp].png`
4. Success toast: "Canvas exported successfully"

**Export Options (Simple):**
- Export entire canvas (5000x5000px)
- Export current viewport only (optional checkbox)
- Background: White (or transparent - checkbox)

#### Technical Approach

**Canvas Export with Konva:**
- Use Konva's built-in `toDataURL()` method
- Set pixelRatio to 2 for higher quality
- Generate PNG data URL
- Trigger browser download with temporary anchor element

**Keyboard Shortcut:**
- Listen for Cmd+E / Ctrl+E
- Prevent default browser behavior
- Call export function

**Quality Settings:**
- pixelRatio: 2 (Retina quality)
- mimeType: 'image/png'
- quality: 1 (maximum)

---

### Feature 5: Copy/Paste Functionality

**Goal:** Support standard copy/paste workflow for canvas objects

#### User Experience

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+C` - Copy selected object(s)
- `Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V` - Paste copied object(s)
- `Cmd+X` / `Ctrl+X` - Cut selected object(s) (copy + delete)

**Behavior:**
- Copy: Selected object(s) copied to internal clipboard
- Paste: Copied object(s) pasted at offset position (+20x, +20y from original)
- Cut: Selected object(s) copied and deleted
- Pasted objects are automatically selected
- Paste works multiple times (each paste creates new objects at further offset)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Toast notification: "1 object copied" or "3 objects copied"
- Toast notification: "Pasted"
- No notification for cut (already covered by delete notification)

#### Technical Approach

**Internal Clipboard:**
- Use React state for clipboard (not browser clipboard)
- Store array of selected objects
- Track paste offset for stacking behavior

**Copy Function:**
- Filter objects by selected IDs
- Store in clipboard state
- Show toast with count

**Paste Function:**
- Clone objects from clipboard
- Generate new unique IDs
- Apply offset to x/y positions
- Create all new objects in Firebase
- Select pasted objects
- Increment offset for next paste

**Cut Function:**
- Call copy function
- Call delete function
- Single notification from delete

**Edge Cases:**
- Pasting with no clipboard â†’ silent (no action)
- Pasting objects off canvas â†’ allow (user can pan)
- Copying 0 objects â†’ silent (no action)
- Reset offset when copying new objects

---

### Feature 6: Lasso Selection Tool

**Goal:** Add free-form selection tool for selecting multiple objects

#### User Experience

**Mode Activation:**
- Add "Lasso Select" button to toolbar (new section)
- Icon: Lasso/rope icon
- Tooltip: "Lasso Select (L)"
- Keyboard shortcut: `L` key toggles lasso mode

**Lasso Mode Behavior:**
1. Click "Lasso Select" button or press `L`
2. Cursor changes to crosshair with lasso icon
3. Click and drag on canvas to draw free-form path
4. Path shown as dashed line while dragging
5. On release, all objects within/intersecting path are selected
6. Mode automatically exits after selection (returns to Pan mode)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Active lasso path shown as animated dashed line
- Path color: Blue (#3B82F6)
- Line width: 2px
- Dash pattern: [5, 5]
- Objects within selection highlight in real-time (preview)

#### Technical Approach

**Lasso Mode State:**
- Add 'lasso' to CanvasMode type ('pan' | 'rectangle' | 'lasso')
- Track lasso path points as array of {x, y}
- Track isActive boolean for drawing state

**Drawing Logic:**
- On mousedown: Start path with initial point
- On mousemove: Append points to path array
- On mouseup: Complete path and select objects

**Selection Algorithm:**
- Use point-in-polygon algorithm (ray casting)
- Check if object center is within lasso path
- Alternative: Check if any corner is within path
- Select all objects that pass the test

**Visual Rendering:**
- Render lasso path as Konva Line component
- Dashed stroke style
- Blue color matching theme
- Remove path after selection complete

**Cursor Management:**
- Change cursor to crosshair in lasso mode
- Disable pan/zoom while in lasso mode
- Disable rectangle creation in lasso mode

**Edge Cases:**
- Lasso with < 3 points â†’ no selection (need closed shape)
- Account for stage transform (pan/zoom)
- Optimize for complex paths if needed

- **Risk:** onDisconnect() may not trigger in all scenarios
- **Mitigation:** Add timestamp-based cleanup (remove users inactive > 2 mins)
- **Fallback:** Manual refresh clears stale presence

**3. Lasso Selection Performance**
- **Risk:** Point-in-polygon algorithm slow with many objects
- **Mitigation:** Only check objects in bounding box first
- **Fallback:** Simplify algorithm to bounding box intersection only

### Medium Risk Items

**4. Export Quality**
- **Risk:** Large canvas (5000x5000) may cause memory issues
- **Mitigation:** Use pixelRatio: 2 max, warn for very large canvases
- **Fallback:** Export viewport only

**5. Notification Spam**
- **Risk:** Too many notifications overwhelm users
- **Mitigation:** Aggressive grouping and debouncing
- **Fallback:** Add user preference to disable

## Questions & Decisions Log

### Q1: Should notifications persist across page refreshes?
**Decision:** No, notifications are ephemeral and session-only  
**Reason:** Keeps implementation simple, not critical for UX

### Q2: Should lasso tool support additive selection (Shift+Lasso)?
**Decision:** No, single selection only for MVP  
**Reason:** Time constraint, can add in future iteration

### Q3: Should export include grid/background?
**Decision:** No, export canvas content only (transparent or white background)  
**Reason:** Cleaner export, more useful for sharing

### Q4: Should we support Cmd+D for duplicate (in addition to copy/paste)?
**Decision:** Not in this PR, may add later  
**Reason:** Copy/paste is more standard and versatile

### Q5: Should connection indicator be dismissible?
**Decision:** No, always visible  
**Reason:** Critical information, should not be hidden

### Q6: Should we debounce presence updates to reduce Firebase costs?
**Decision:** Yes, already throttled to 50ms (existing implementation)  
**Reason:** Good balance of responsiveness and cost

### Q7: Should lasso selection clear on Escape?
**Decision:** Yes, consistent with other selections  
**Reason:** Standard behavior, expected by users
