   - `firebase.mdc` - Firebase-specific patterns and best practices
   - `react-components.mdc` - React component patterns
   - AI-powered coding guidelines with `alwaysApply: true`

3. **README.md Updates**
   - Added "Documentation & Project Intelligence" section
   - Documented Memory Bank files and purpose
   - Documented Project Rules system
   - Updated Features list to include canvas list, URL sharing, dual modes
   - Enhanced "How to Use" with canvas management instructions
   - Updated Tech Stack to include React Router and Lucide icons

### Completed: PR #15 - Canvas Ownership & URL-Based Sharing
**Completed**: October 14, 2025  
**Impact**: Major feature addition

#### What Was Added
1. **Multiple Canvas Support**
   - Users can create unlimited canvases
   - Each canvas has unique ID and URL
   - Canvas metadata stored in `/canvases/{canvasId}`

2. **Canvas List Page**
   - New landing page at `/` route
   - Shows "My Canvases" and "Shared With Me" sections
   - Search by canvas name (debounced 300ms)
   - Create, rename, delete canvases
   - Sorted by most recently opened

3. **URL-Based Sharing**
   - Share canvas by copying URL: `/canvas/{canvasId}`
   - Anyone with link can access (no explicit share button)
   - Authenticated users auto-added to canvas on first visit
   - `lastOpenedBy` tracks who accessed each canvas

4. **React Router Integration**
   - `/` → Canvas List Page
   - `/canvas/:canvasId` → Canvas Editor Page
   - Navigation between pages
   - URL parameters for canvas identification

5. **Canvas Editor Enhancements**
   - Top nav bar with back button, canvas name, online users
   - Canvas name clickable to rename (owner only)
   - Full-screen layout (nav + canvas)

6. **UI Components Added**
   - `CanvasCard`: Display canvas in grid
   - `CreateCanvasModal`: Create new canvas
   - `RenameCanvasModal`: Rename canvas
   - `ConfirmDialog`: Delete/leave confirmations
   - `Toast`: Success/error notifications
   - `LoadingSpinner`: Loading states
   - `EmptyState`: No canvases/no results states

7. **Context Updates**
   - `CanvasListContext`: Manage user's canvases
   - `ToastContext`: Global notifications
   - `CanvasContext`: Now accepts `canvasId` prop
   - `PresenceContext`: Now accepts `canvasId` prop

8. **Firebase Structure Changes**
   - `/canvases/{canvasId}` → Canvas metadata
   - `/objects/{canvasId}/{objectId}` → Canvas objects
   - `/presence/{canvasId}/{userId}` → Canvas presence
   - Security rules updated for per-canvas access

### Previously Completed: MVP Features (PR #1-13)
All core MVP features working:
- Authentication (Email Link + Google)
- Canvas rendering with Konva
- Rectangle creation, movement, deletion
- Real-time sync (<100ms)
- Multiplayer cursors (<50ms)
- Presence system
- Pan/zoom (60 FPS)
- Mode switching (Pan/Rectangle)
- Deployed to Firebase Hosting

## Current Focus
**Status**: No active development  
**State**: Maintenance mode

The application is feature-complete for the current scope and deployed to production. All planned MVP and enhancement features have been implemented.

## Next Steps
No immediate work planned. Potential future enhancements documented in `productContext.md` under "Future Enhancements."

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Recently Resolved
1. **Canvas Storage Model**: Using Firebase Realtime DB paths with canvas IDs ✅
2. **Sharing Model**: URL-based sharing (no explicit share UI) ✅
3. **Navigation**: React Router with two main routes ✅
4. **Canvas Isolation**: Objects and presence scoped per canvas ✅
5. **Mode Switching**: Pan vs Rectangle mode with keyboard shortcuts ✅

### Open Questions
