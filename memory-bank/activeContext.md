## Current Focus
**Status**: Active Development  
**State**: Building AI Canvas Agent (Priority #1)

Working on implementing natural language interface for canvas operations using OpenAI GPT-4. The AI will enable users to create and manipulate shapes using simple commands like "create 3 blue rectangles" or "arrange all shapes in a grid". Current focus is on integrating Firebase Cloud Functions with OpenAI Agents SDK and implementing the 14 AI tools.

**Immediate Priorities**:
1. Complete Task 3.22: Test full AI workflow with real OpenAI API key
2. Implement Task 5.0: AI mode toggle (Auto/Confirm modes)
3. Complete Task 6.0: Performance testing (sub-2s response, 90%+ success rate)

## Next Steps
**Current Phase** (AI Canvas Agent):
1. ✅ Task 1.0: Firebase Cloud Functions setup with emulators
2. ✅ Task 2.0: UI components (chat panel, modals, toggle)
3. ✅ Task 3.0: Cloud Function backend with OpenAI (mostly complete, needs testing)
4. ✅ Task 4.0: All 14 AI tools implemented
5. ⏳ Task 5.0: AI mode toggle with localStorage - Next Up
6. ⏳ Task 6.0: Performance testing and rubric compliance - Critical

**After AI Canvas Agent**:
1. **Undo/Redo** - Implement command pattern for operation history
2. **Copy/Paste** - Enable shape duplication across canvases
3. **Shape Grouping** - Logical grouping of shapes that persist
4. **Export/Import** - Export to PNG/SVG/PDF, import images
5. **Layers & Z-Index** - Layer management and shape ordering

## Active Decisions & Considerations

5. **Mode Switching**: Pan mode with multiple shape type modes + dedicated Select mode ✅
6. **Testing Standards**: Vitest framework, tests in `tests/` directory ✅
7. **Shape Type System**: Union types and type guards for all shapes ✅
8. **Text Editing UX**: Modal editor with formatting options (bold, italic, underline) ✅
9. **Shape Creation Flow**: Click-drag for Circle/Line, double-click for Text editing ✅
10. **Toolbar Design**: Modern left-side vertical toolbar with shape selector and color picker ✅

13. **Selection Box Strategy**: Complete containment (not intersection) ✅
14. **Line Storage Model**: (x, y, width, height, rotation) format for consistency with other shapes ✅
15. **Rotation Origin**: Center-based rotation for all rotatable shapes (rectangles, lines, text) ✅
16. **Circle Resize**: Corner-only with uniform scaling, no rotation ✅
17. **Line Handles**: Custom endpoint handles for intuitive editing ✅
18. **Text Scaling**: Aspect ratio locked, font size 8-72pt with position lock at limits ✅

### AI Canvas Agent Decisions
22. **AI Backend Architecture**: Firebase Cloud Functions with OpenAI Agents SDK (server-side) ✅
23. **API Key Security**: Stored in Firebase Functions secrets, never exposed to client ✅
24. **Local Development**: Firebase Emulator Suite for functions, auth, and database ✅
25. **AI Model**: GPT-4 (gpt-4-turbo-preview) for reliability and function calling ✅
26. **Tool Count**: 14 tools across 4 categories (creation, manipulation, layout, context) ✅
27. **Response Time Target**: <2 seconds for 90%+ of commands (rubric requirement) ⚡
28. **Success Rate Target**: 90%+ command success rate (rubric requirement) ⚡
29. **AI Modes**: Auto mode (immediate execution) and Confirm mode (preview first) ✅
30. **Mode Persistence**: LocalStorage with key 'ai-mode-preference' ✅
31. **Smart Positioning**: Use viewport center (focal point) for shape placement ✅
32. **Auto-Selection**: AI-created/modified shapes automatically selected after execution ✅
33. **Color Defaults**: AI uses currently selected color and stroke width from toolbar ✅
34. **View Management**: Auto-frame AI-generated shapes with smooth animation ✅

### Open Questions
**AI Canvas Agent**:
1. Should confirmation mode show visual preview or text summary? (Decision: Text summary for MVP)
2. Should AI have access to command history for context? (Decision: Out of scope for MVP)
3. Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute sufficient? (Decision: Test and tune during Phase 5)
