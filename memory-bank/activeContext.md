**Impact**: Major feature enhancement enabling advanced shape manipulation
**PRD**: `tasks/prd-multi-select-transforms.md`  
**Tasks**: `tasks/tasks-prd-multi-select-transforms.md`

#### What Was Added
1. **Multi-Select System** ✅
   - Updated selection state to support arrays of shape IDs
   - Five selection methods: single click, Shift+click, drag-to-select box, Ctrl/Cmd+A, Select mode
   - Visual selection box with dashed border for drag-to-select
   - Complete containment strategy (shapes must be fully within box)
   - Group operations: move, delete, color change, line thickness
   - Bounding boxes visible for all selected shapes
   - Dedicated Select mode with BoxSelect icon (dashed square)

2. **Transform Operations - Resize** ✅
   - Konva.Transformer integration for single-shape resize
   - 8-point handles (4 corners, 4 edges) for rectangles and text
   - Shift key to lock aspect ratio during resize
   - Min/max size constraints enforced
   - Shape-specific behaviors:
     - **Rectangles**: Full 8-point resize
     - **Circles**: Corner-only resize, uniform scaling (no rotation)
     - **Lines**: Custom endpoint handles for free movement
     - **Text**: Corner-only resize, aspect ratio locked, font size 8-72pt

3. **Transform Operations - Rotation** ✅
   - Center-based rotation for rectangles, lines, and text
   - 15° angle snapping by default
